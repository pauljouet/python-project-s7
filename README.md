# S7 Python Project

The goal of the project is to study a dataset and apply learning methods on it, using Python and packages such as sklearn, pandas and numpy.
In our case, we will study the [YearPredictionMSD Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). The elements of the dataset are 515345 songs, with 90 attributes representing timbres, and the target is the release year of the song.

The dataset contains mostly western and pop music, and the audio features are described as real numbers.
We will try modelling a regression for estimating the release year of a song. We might also try another approach using ranges of years (70s, 80s... for example) if the results are not satisfying.
