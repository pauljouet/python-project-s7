# S7 Python Project

The goal of the project is to study a dataset and apply learning methods on it, using Python and packages such as sklearn, pandas and numpy.
In my case, I will study the [YearPredictionMSD Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). The elements of the dataset are 515345 songs, with 90 attributes each, and target is the release year of the song.
